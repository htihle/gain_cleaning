# gain_cleaning

Code for using the measured Tsys spectrum to disentangle gain fluctuations from temperature fluctuations in COMAP time-ordered data. This allows us to remove gain fluctuations from observations of continuum sources. 

This is mostly code written by Jonas Lunde (https://github.com/jgslunde/comap_general) and gathered together by me here to make a self-contained code that implements the method for TauA continuum measurements as an example.

For discussion and details on the method see chapter 9 of Jonas' master thesis: http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-91042.
